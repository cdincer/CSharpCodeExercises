        #region Queue: First-in-first-out Data Structure
        #region Queue - Implementation


        #region Design Circular Queue
        /*
        Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

        One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

        Implement the MyCircularQueue class:

            MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
            int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
            int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
            boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
            boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
            boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
            boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

        You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language. 

        

        Example 1:

        Input
        ["MyCircularQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "Rear", "isFull", "deQueue", "enQueue", "Rear"]
        [[3], [1], [2], [3], [4], [], [], [], [4], []]
        Output
        [null, true, true, true, false, 3, true, true, true, 4]

        Explanation
        MyCircularQueue myCircularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3);
        myCircularQueue.enQueue(1); // return True
        myCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True
        myCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True
        myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return False
        myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 3
        myCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True
        myCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True
        myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True
        myCircularQueue.Rear();     // return 4

        #region Open the Lock
        /*
        You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. 
        The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

        The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

        You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

        Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

        Example 1:

        Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
        Output: 6
        Explanation: 
        A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
        Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
        because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".

        Example 2:

        Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".

        Example 3:

        Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
        Output: -1
        Explanation: We cannot reach the target without getting stuck.

        Constraints:

            1 <= deadends.length <= 500
            deadends[i].length == 4
            target.length == 4
            target will not be in the list deadends.
            target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.

        Hint:
        We can think of this problem as a shortest path problem on a graph: there are `10000` nodes (strings `'0000'` to `'9999'`), 
        and there is an edge between two nodes if they differ in one digit, 
        that digit differs by 1 (wrapping around, so `'0'` and `'9'` differ by 1), and if *both* nodes are not in `deadends`.

            At most 3 * 104 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and getMin.

        https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/

        Explanation:
            
        Initialize 2 stacks a normal stack and a stack to track a minimum value.
        On Push(), if minimumStack is not empty, check the top min value and if it is greater or equal to the new coming in, then push new value as new min on top of the minimumstack and then push value to original stack.
        On Pop(), get the popped value if it is equal to the top of minimumStack then pop from both.
        On Top(), Peek the top value from the stack.
        On GetMin(), peek the top value from minimumStack.

        Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
        Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

        class Node {
            public int val;
            public List<Node> neighbors;
        }    

        Test case format:
        For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). 
        For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. 
        The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
        An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
        The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

        Example 1:

        Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
        Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
        Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
        1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
        2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
        3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
        4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

        Example 2:

        Input: adjList = [[]]
        Output: [[]]
        Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

        Example 3:

        Input: adjList = []
        Output: []
        Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

        Constraints:

        The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
        1 <= Node.val <= 100
        Node.val is unique for each node.
        There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
        The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

        C# Only Test Case Equal to First Graph shown on page:
        Node nodeOne = new Node(1);Node nodeTwo = new Node(2);
        Node nodeThree = new Node(3);Node nodeFour = new Node(4);
        nodeOne.neighbors.Add(nodeTwo);nodeOne.neighbors.Add(nodeFour);
        nodeTwo.neighbors.Add(nodeOne);nodeTwo.neighbors.Add(nodeThree);

        #region Implement Queue using Stacks
        /*
        Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

        Implement the MyQueue class:

            void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
            int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
            int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
            boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

        Notes:

            You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
            Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

        Example 1:

        Input
        ["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
        [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
        Output
        [null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

        Explanation
        MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
        myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
        myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
        myQueue.peek(); // return 1
        myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
        myQueue.empty(); // return false

        Constraints:

            1 <= x <= 9
            At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
            All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

        Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
        You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

         Flood Fill

        ***Personal Note: A different version of connecting islands. Took the cue from there.
        ***Used the same technique for custom solution below.
        An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.
        You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

        To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, 
        plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. 
        Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
        Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

        Example 1:
        Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
        Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
        Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
        Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.

        Example 2:
        Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
        Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
        Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.

        Constraints:

            m == image.length
            n == image[i].length
