        An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

        You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) 
        You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
        The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
        Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

        #region Clone Graph
        /*
        Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
        Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
        Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

        class Node {
            public int val;
            public List<Node> neighbors;
        }

        Test case format:
        For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.
        An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
        The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

        Example 1:
        Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
        Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
        Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
        1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
        2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
        3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
        4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

        Example 2:
        Input: adjList = [[]]
        Output: [[]]
        Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

        Example 3:
        Input: adjList = []
        Output: []
        Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

        Constraints:

            The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
            1 <= Node.val <= 100
            Node.val is unique for each node.
            There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
            The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

        edges = [[2,3,4,14],[1,7,11],[1],[1,5,6,8],[4,9],[4],[2,10],[4,13],[5,12,16],[7],[2],[9,15],[8],[1],[12],[9]] 17 / 22 testcases passed

        There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.
        The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).
        The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. 
        Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.
        Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
        
        Example 1:
        Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
        Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
        Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
        [0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
        [1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
        [1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
        [2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
        [3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
        [3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
        [4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
            [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
        Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

        Example 2:
        Input: heights = [[1]]
        Output: [[0,0]]
        Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

        /*
        Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
        A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

        

        Example 1:
        Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
        Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
        Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
        - It is on the border, or
        - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
        The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
        The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

        Example 2:
        Input: board = [["X"]]

        indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
        Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

        Example 1:

        Output: [0,1]
        Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
