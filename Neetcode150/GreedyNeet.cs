        Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
        Output: 6
        Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.

        There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
        You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. 
        You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, 
        return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction,
         otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

        Example 1:
        Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
        Output: 3
        Explanation:
        Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
        Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8

        Example 2:
        Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
        Output: -1
        Explanation:
        You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
        Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
        Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
        Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
        You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
        Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

        You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.
        To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times (possibly zero):
            Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].
            For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[j] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].

        #region Valid Parenthesis String
        /*
        Given a string s containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', return true if s is valid.
        The following rules define a valid string:

            Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
            Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
            Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
            '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".

        Example 1:
        Input: s = "()"
        Output: true

        Example 2:
        Input: s = "(*)"
        Output: true

        Example 3:
        Input: s = "(*))"
        Output: true

        Constraints:
            1 <= s.length <= 100
            s[i] is '(', ')' or '*'.
