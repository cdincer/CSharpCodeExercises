        Example 2:
        Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
        Output: true
        Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
        Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

        Example 3:
        Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
        Output: false

        Constraints:

            1 <= s.length <= 300
            1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
            1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
            s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
            All the strings of wordDict are unique.

        /*
        Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing
        subsequence.
        
        Example 1:
        Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

        Example 2:
        Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
        Output: 4

        Example 3:
        Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]

        Constraints:

            1 <= nums.length <= 2500
            -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

        Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or false otherwise.

        Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
        Output: true
        Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
