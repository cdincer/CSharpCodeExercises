        #region Reconstruct Itinerary
        /*
        You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.
        All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
        For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
        You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

        Example 1:
        Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
        Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

        Example 2:
        Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
        Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
        Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.

        Constraints:

            1 <= tickets.length <= 300
            tickets[i].length == 2
            fromi.length == 3
            toi.length == 3
            fromi and toi consist of uppercase English letters.
            fromi != toi

        Extra Test Cases:
        [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]] Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

        We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
        Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

        if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

        Premium Question on Leetcode / Neetcode.io  https://neetcode.io/problems/foreign-dictionary
        There is a foreign language which uses the latin alphabet, but the order among letters is not "a", "b", "c" ... "z" as in English.
        You receive a list of non-empty strings words from the dictionary, where the words are sorted lexicographically based on the rules of this new language.
        Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order is invalid, return an empty string. If there are multiple valid order of letters, return any of them.
        A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if either of the following is true:

            The first letter where they differ is smaller in a than in b.
            There is no index i such that a[i] != b[i] and a.length < b.length.

        Example 1:
        Input: ["z","o"]
        Output: "zo"
        Explanation:
        From "z" and "o", we know 'z' < 'o', so return "zo".

        Example 2:
        Input: ["hrn","hrf","er","enn","rfnn"]
        Output: "hernf"
        Explanation:

            from "hrn" and "hrf", we know 'n' < 'f'
            from "hrf" and "er", we know 'h' < 'e'
            from "er" and "enn", we know get 'r' < 'n'
            from "enn" and "rfnn" we know 'e'<'r'
            so one possibile solution is "hernf"

        Constraints:

            The input words will contain characters only from lowercase 'a' to 'z'.
            1 <= words.length <= 100

        #region Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
        /*
        There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, to i, price i] 
        indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city to i with cost price i.
        You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.

        Example 1
        Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
        Output: 700
        Explanation:
        The graph is shown above.
        The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
        Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
        Output: 200
        Explanation:
        The graph is shown above.
        The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.

        Example 3:
        Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
        Output: 500
        Explanation:
        The graph is shown above.
        The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.

        Constraints:

            1 <= n <= 100
            0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
            flights[i].length == 3
            0 <= fromi, toi < n
            fromi != toi
            1 <= pricei <= 104
            There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
            0 <= src, dst, k < n
            src != dst
