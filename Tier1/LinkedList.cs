        https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/


        Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
        A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
        If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

        Implement the MyLinkedList class:

        MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
        int get(int index) -- Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
        void addAtHead(int val) -- Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
        void addAtTail(int val) -- Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
        void addAtIndex(int index, int val) --  Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
        void deleteAtIndex(int index) -- Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

    
        Example 1:

        Input
        ["MyLinkedList", "addAtHead", "addAtTail", "addAtIndex", "get", "deleteAtIndex", "get"]
        [[], [1], [3], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]]
        Output
        [null, null, null, null, 2, null, 3]

        Explanation
        MyLinkedList myLinkedList = new MyLinkedList();
        myLinkedList.addAtHead(1);
        myLinkedList.addAtTail(3);
        myLinkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);    // linked list becomes 1->2->3
        myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 2
        myLinkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);    // now the linked list is 1->3
        myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 3

        

        Constraints:

        0 <= index, val <= 1000
        Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.
        At most 2000 calls will be made to get, addAtHead, addAtTail, addAtIndex and deleteAtIndex.

        Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

        There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. 
        Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

        Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
        Output: true
        Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

        Example 2:

        Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
        Output: true
        Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

        Example 3:

        Input: head = [1], pos = -1
        Output: false
        Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

        

        Constraints:

            The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
            -105 <= Node.val <= 105
            pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

        /*
        Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

        For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:

        The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

        Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

        Custom Judge:

        The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

            intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
            listA - The first linked list.
            listB - The second linked list.
            skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
            skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

        The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
        Output: Intersected at '8'
        Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
        From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
        - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

        Example 2:

        Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
        Output: Intersected at '2'
        Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
        From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

        Example 3:

        Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
        Output: No intersection
        Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
        Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

        You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.

        Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let curr be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after curr and before curr.next in the flattened list.

        Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to null.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

        Output: [1,3,2]
        Explanation: The multilevel linked list in the input is shown.
        After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

        Example 3:

        Input: head = []
        Output: []
        Explanation: There could be empty list in the input.

        

        Constraints:

            The number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
            1 <= Node.val <= 105

        

        How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:

        We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

        1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
                |
                7---8---9---10--NULL
                    |
                    11--12--NULL

        The serialization of each level is as follows:

        [1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
        [7,8,9,10,null]
        [11,12,null]

        To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

        [1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
                    |
        [null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]
                        |
        [            null, 11, 12, null]

        Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

        [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
