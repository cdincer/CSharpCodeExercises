        We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
        I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
        Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
        You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

        -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
         1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
         0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

         Return the number that I picked.

        There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

        A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
        Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
