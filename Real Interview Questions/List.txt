312. Burst Balloons
You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons.
If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.
Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation:
nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] --> [3,8] --> [8] --> []
coins =  3*1*5    +   3*5*8   +  1*3*8  + 1*8*1 = 167

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5]
Output: 10

Constraints:
    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 300
    0 <= nums[i] <= 100

2443. Sum of Number and Its Reverse

Given a non-negative integer num, return true if num can be expressed as the sum of any non-negative integer and its reverse, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: num = 443
Output: true
Explanation: 172 + 271 = 443 so we return true.

Example 2:
Input: num = 63
Output: false
Explanation: 63 cannot be expressed as the sum of a non-negative integer and its reverse so we return false.

Example 3:
Input: num = 181
Output: true
Explanation: 140 + 041 = 181 so we return true. Note that when a number is reversed, there may be leading zeros.

Constraints:
    0 <= num <= 105
